"<em>Experimental Beijing: Gender and Globalization in Chinese Contemporary
Art</em>is a book by Sasha Su-Ling Welland, published by Duke University Press
in 2018. Grounded in ethnographic and visual interpretation, it examines the
interlocking power dynamics involved in Chinese contemporary art as a global
phenomenon at the turning point of the early twenty-first century. A focus on
gender highlights contradictions within this emerging art world and generates
feminist sight lines onto the shifting role of art during this experimental era.
This website, designed to complement and visually deepen the experience of
reading the book, features expanded multimedia materials and provides readers
with a nonlinear way to explore the image worlds it proposes."
