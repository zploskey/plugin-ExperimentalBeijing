"<em>Experimental Beijing: Gender and Globalization in Chinese Contemporary
Art</em> (Duke University Press, 2018) is a book by Sasha Su-Ling Welland.
Grounded in ethnographic and visual interpretation, it explores Chinese
contemporary art at the turn of the millennium as a zone of cultural encounter
â€” between ideas of masculinity and femininity, public and private, rural and
urban, China and the world. A feminist lens provides insight into the
interlocking power dynamics involved in the shifting role of art during an era
of experimentation. This digital companion, designed to complement and visually
deepen the experience of reading the book, features expanded multimedia
materials and provides readers with a nonlinear way to explore the image worlds
it proposes."
